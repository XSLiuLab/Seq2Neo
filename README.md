# Seq2Neo: a comprehensive toolkit for cancer neoantigen prediction

## Overview
Neoantigen prediction has become a crucial step in cancer treatment. In recent years, several bioinformatics tools are available for cancer neoantigen prediction. However, currently available neoantigen prediction tools provide a limited process or focus on specific genome alterations, such as SNVs. This package **Seq2Neo**, helps users complete the complex process from raw data to neoantigen at one time

## Installation:
### Pip
You can install the stable release of **Seq2Neo** with:
